CPU: 80 MHz
C4 frequency: 261.63 Hz
CPU speed compared to C4 frequency: (80 * 10^6)/ 261.63 = 305775.33

We want to create a signal consisting of 1's and 0's in given intervalls and varying length. The average of the signals should ressult in a sinewave which in turn will generate a tone to the speaker.

So the question is how to define the intervalls and lengths in the program. Maybe use a function to calculate the sine-value and then depending on that compute if the signal should be 1 or 0.

Have interrupts send sinals to the speaker. Depending on the value of a counter it will send 1 or 0.
